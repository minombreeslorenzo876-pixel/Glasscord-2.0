# Glasscord

Glasscord is a clean, modern, and rounded Discord theme inspired by liquid glass aesthetics.

It combines soft blur effects, subtle brightness, and smooth animations to create an elegant and modern interface.

✨ Features

- Beautiful frosted glass look with adjustable blur and brightness
- Smooth transitions and motion effects
- Rounded corners for a modern UI feel
- Fully compatible with Vencord and BetterDiscord

⚙️ Customization

You can easily tweak the glass effect to match your personal style.

You can experiment with these values until you find your preferred look.
For example:

:root {
  --blur-strength: 1.5rem;
  --brightness-level: 0.9;
}
